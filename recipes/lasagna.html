        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A traditional lasagna, with about half the time and effort!
            Cook some extra so you can have leftovers (if the lasagna survives).
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pound of bulk Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¹/² cup of warm water</li>
            <li>1 cup of sliced black olives</li>
            <li>1 pinch of basil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 ¹/² teaspoons of dried sage</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of dried onion flakes</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) jars of marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package of lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound of mozzzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a 
                large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess 
                grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and 
                season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, 
                pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer 
                for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir 
                in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom 
                of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of 
                dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese 
                over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella 
                cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat 
                layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve 
                about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check 
                after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. 
                Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into 
                it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and 
                return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice 
                melted cheese topping.
            </li>
        </ol>
