        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>I've tried many different ways to make a great, 
            easy, hard-boiled egg with a soft white and a 
            nice fluffy yolk that's not grey on the outside. 
            After lots of trial and error, I've finally 
            done it. After cooking I usually keep them in 
            the shell until I need them. Enjoy! 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place eggs into a saucepan and fill with water 
                until eggs are just barely covered.
            </li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil. Boil eggs for 4 1/2 
                minutes. Remove from heat and let eggs sit in 
                hot water for 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer eggs to a bowl and either peel and 
                serve, or keep shells on and place in the 
                refrigerator until you are ready to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
